# sparkle-horn

Working title for a project to support community and social media in the Burlesque community, to support managing and owning our own data.

Currently, this project is in initial research stages.

## Basic Approach

I would suggest:
1. Identify features
2. Research and select an open source package.
3. Deploy and configure.
4. Invite a board/admin/moderator staff. Get that in place.
5. Make public announcements and handle invites (with help of new moderators).

## General Features

Forums are seen as vastly superior to most social media.

They can be a difficult moderate.

Primary goal is to have a forum where the regional burlesque community (as in performers, producers, and techs) can discuss the scene/post casting calls, etc. Something to take the place of the Facebook groups we're using for it now. 

Slow expansion.

Don't want to monetize it, and the only ads should be posts from members advertising their own burlesque-adjacent services.

UI that can be configured by the end user (colors, layout, etc.)

possibly DM functionality

Public sections, account holder only sections, and then members-only sections within the account holder sections. Like:
* A costuming section of the forum might be publicly viewable to someone searching the internet for how to make a boa.
* A "what are the photography norms in your city" thread would be viewable only to people logged in with an account.
* The local-specific casting call group would be viewable only to logged in members who have been specifically invited to join it.

I definitely think I want it to be invite-only with vetting as we get it off the ground, just to make sure the people joining are actual performers.

## Initial Research

This is an info dump of initial reseach into open source projects that could meet the requirements.
